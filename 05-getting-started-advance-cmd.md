# Getting Started with Advance Commands

## Basic Advance Commands
- `curl` -- transfer data from or to another computer or vice-versa
- `mount` -- mounting a storage to a host
- `for` -- for-loop 
- `while` -- the opposite of for-loops
- `awk` -- manipulates outputs and organizes them 
- `sed` -- ^^ same

## Operators
- `&&` -- and
- `||` -- or
- `==` -- equals
- `!=` -- does not equal 
- `=>` -- equal to or greater than
- `=<` -- equal to or less than
- `>` -- greater than
- `<` -- less than
- `|` -- pipe (aka to chain/combo a command)
- `;` -- to run multipe commands at once

I don't expect you to learn all of the commands or operators but knowing most of them will make your job easier.
