# Getting Started with Networking

## Basic Network Commands
- `ps` -- list process status
- `find` -- outputs every possible path
- `which` -- locates the location of a command 
- `uname` -- outputs computer info
- `nslookup` -- looks for computer names via ip address and vice-versa
- `host` -- looks up dns name related to a ip address
- `ssh` -- secure shell (aka login into a linux server)
- `ifconfig` -- output network configurations (aka `ipconfig` on windows)
- `nslookup` -- tool to look up internet domain server names (DNS).
- `host` -- similar to `nslookup` but much simpler
- `telnet` -- network tool to check connectivity from source to destination on a certain port (old command and typically on windows computers)
- `nc` -- netcat is similar to telnet but more robust with features
- `traceroute` -- output the path to a server (handy when troubleshooting where the issue is)

Computer network is a subject too big to cover entirely but will try my best to cover what I know and fix your understand.
